icpc: The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is an algorithmic programming contest 
      for college students. Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve the most 
      real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to 
      perform under pressure. Through training and competition, teams challenge each other to raise 
      the bar on the possible. Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world. <a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/abouticpc" target="_blank">More about ICPC...</a>
