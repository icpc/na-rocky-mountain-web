## PRACTICE TIME

The official practice time will be Friday from 7:00-9:00PM. Practice will be held at Contest Location. The regional judges will operate their servers and
contestants will be given a few practice problems that parallel the format of the actual problems on Saturday. All teams are strongly encouraged to attend.
This gives you a chance to be familiar with the contest, systems, tools and debugging techniques prior to the contest.  It also allows us to ensure that
there are no errors in how teams are set up, that everyone can submit to the system, etc.

There will be NO official practice time on Saturday before the contest.
The contest runs from 12:00 to 5:00 PM, and is sometimes slightly extended for fairness purposes. Teams are recommended to wear contest shirts during
the competition if they get one.

## COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT

Each team will get one Linux virtual machine with a configuration like the [world-finals environment](https://icpc.baylor.edu/worldfinals/programming-environment).

Unlike recent years, we will not be using the [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com) online judge, we will instead be using PC^2.

**Additional details will follow.

## PC^2 ACCOUNT / ALLOWED MATERIALS

Any material, online or printed, that was created prior to the contest will be allowed.

## HOTEL

Guests staying Friday night can book at one of the many hotels in town. There is not a specific hotel that we recommend, nor are there rooms blocked
or a special rate for the contest.

## FOOD

You may bring your own food/beverages/snacks if you wish. Please note there is no food allowed in the computer labs/working area.
