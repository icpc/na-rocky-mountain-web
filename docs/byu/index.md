## PRACTICE TIME

The official practice time will be Friday from 7:00-9:00PM. Practice will be held at the Contest Location. The regional judges will operate their servers and
contestants will be given a few practice problems that parallel the format of the actual problems on Saturday. All teams are strongly encouraged to attend.
This gives you a chance to be familiar with the contest, systems, tools and debugging techniques prior to the contest.  It also allows us to ensure that
there are no errors in how teams are set up, that everyone can submit to the system, etc.

There will be NO official practice time on Saturday before the contest.
The contest runs from 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM, and is sometimes slightly extended for fairness purposes. Teams are requested to wear the official contest shirts during
the competition if they get one.

## COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT

Each team will receive a workstation with a Linux virtual machine with a configuration akin to the [world-finals environment](https://docs.icpc.global/worldfinals-programming-environment/).

We will again be using the [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com) online judge.

*Additional details about the competition platform will be available soon.*

## ALLOWED MATERIALS

Any material, online or printed, that was created *prior* to the contest will be allowed.

## HOTEL

Guests staying Friday night can book at one of the many hotels in town. There is not a specific hotel that we recommend, nor are there rooms blocked
or a special rate for the contest.

## FOOD / MENU

We will be providing dinner on Friday evening and will provide breakfast, lunch, and dinner on Saturday (before, during and after the contest).

You may bring your own food/beverages/snacks if you wish.  
Please note that there is no food allowed in the computer labs/working area.  Any beverages in the lab must be in an enclosed container so that they does not spill if you tip them.

If you have any special dietary needs, please email Ryan Farrell directly (see below).  We will do our best to accommodate such requests.
