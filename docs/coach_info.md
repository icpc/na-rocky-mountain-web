# Information for Coaches

The coach is the official point-of-contact with the team prior to and during contest activities. A team may only have one coach and the coach cannot also be a contestant.

Whether you are seasoned ICPC coach, or you’re just exploring the possibility of sending teams to the ICPC Mid-Central USA regional contest, you should make sure you’ve done the following:

- Assemble one or more teams, each consisting of exactly three eligible students each, plus an optional reserve. Please see the official [ICPC Regional Rules](https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/rules) for more details on contestant eligibility. This [PDF flowchart](https://icpc.baylor.edu/download/regionals/rules/EligibilityDecisionTree-2018.pdf) can also help you determine whether a contestant is eligible to participate in ICPC.
- Fully [register your team(s)](https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/coach-instructions) before the deadline. You must provide complete team member information before the deadline, or the registration will be cancelled.
- Pay the registration fees for your team (the information/link for this is also included in the Registration page)
- Understand the regional contest rules.
- Study the notes to teams.
- Be familiar with your site’s facilities.
- Help your team(s) practice.
- Arrange for transportation to and from the contest site.
