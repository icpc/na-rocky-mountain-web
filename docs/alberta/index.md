## BANQUET
The banquet will held on campus at the U of A. The exact location is to be determined (likely in Lister Conference Centre).

## PRACTICE CONTEST

The official practice time will be on Friday after dinner. Practice will be held at Contest Location. The regional judges will operate their servers and contestants will be given a few practice problems that parallel the format of the actual problems on Saturday. All teams are strongly encouraged to attend. This gives you a chance to be familiar with the contest, systems, tools and debugging techniques prior to the contest.

There will be NO official practice time on Saturday before the contest.
Teams should wear contest shirts during the competition if they get one.

## LOCAL RESOURCES

Each team will be provided a workstation with a Linux configuration akin to the [world-finals environment](https://docs.icpc.global/worldfinals-programming-environment/). Read the description at that site for language versions, editors/IDEs, compilation/running instructions, and references that will be available locally on the image.

We will again be using the [Kattis online judge](https://open.kattis.com/) for the contest. The official programming languages supported for the contest are: C, C++, Java, Kotlin and Python 3.


## HOTEL

Guests staying Friday night can book at one of the many hotels in town. There is not a specific hotel that we recommend, nor are there rooms blocked or a special rate for the contest.

## FOOD

You may bring your own food/beverages/snacks if you wish, but we will be providing dinner on Friday as well as breakfast/lunch/dinner on Saturday. Please note there is no food allowed in the computer labs/working area. Any beverages in the lab must be in an enclosed container so it does not spill if you tip it.

If you have special dietary needs, please let us know as soon as possible by emailing Zachary Friggstad directly. We will do our best to meet these requests and will let you know what to expect.
