## PRACTICE TIME

The official practice time will be on Friday after dinner. Practice will be held at Contest Location. The regional judges will operate their servers and contestants will be given a few practice problems that parallel the format of the actual problems on Saturday. All teams are strongly encouraged to attend. This gives you a chance to be familiar with the contest, systems, tools and debugging techniques prior to the contest.

There will be NO official practice time on Saturday before the contest.
The contest runs from 12:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Teams are recommended to wear contest shirts during the competition if they get one.

## LOCAL RESOURCES

## HOTEL

Guests staying Friday night can book at one of the many hotels in town. There is not a specific hotel that we recommend, nor are there rooms blocked or a special rate for the contest.

## FOOD

You may bring your own food/beverages/snacks if you wish, but we will be providing dinner on Friday as well as breakfast/lunch/dinner on Saturday. Please note there is no food allowed in the computer labs/working area. Any beverages in the lab must be in an enclosed container so it does not spill if you tip it.

If you have special dietary needs, please let us know as soon as possible by emailing Zachary Friggstad directly. We will do our best to meet these requests and will let you know what to expect.
